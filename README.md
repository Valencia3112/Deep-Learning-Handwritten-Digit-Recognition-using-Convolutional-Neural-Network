Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network

# Objective

Nowdays, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an emergent topic in machine learning. It has lead its importance in various different applications such as music and speech recognition, image processing, and sentence classification to name a few. We need to achieve high accuracy rate close to human brainâ€™s neural network, to gain high accuracy as close to 100% as possible and minimization of the error rate. Various techniques have been proposed over the years to achieve these goals.
